## How It Works

- **Frontend:** A sleek, single-page chat interface (`index.html`) where you can interact with JobBot.
- **Backend API:** The `/api/chat` endpoint forwards your questions to the OpenRouter API (using the `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct` model) and returns AI-generated responses.
- **CORS Proxy:** A local proxy server (`proxy.js` using `cors-anywhere`) is included to handle cross-origin requests if needed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher recommended)
- An [OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JobBot.git
   cd JobBot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   cd cors-proxy
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Set your OpenRouter API key:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
     ```
     OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
     ```

### Running the App

#### 1. Start the CORS Proxy (if needed)
```sh
node proxy.js
```
- This runs a CORS proxy at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

#### 2. Serve the Frontend
- You can open `index.html` directly in your browser, or use a static server like [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve):
  ```sh
  npx serve .
  ```

#### 3. Start the API (if using a serverless or Node.js backend)
- Deploy `api/chat.js` as an API endpoint (e.g., with Vercel, Netlify, or your own Node.js server).

## Usage

- Open the chat interface in your browser.
- Ask JobBot anything about jobs, applications, resumes, or career advice.
- JobBot will respond with professional, industry-neutral guidance.

## Customization

- **Model:** The default model is `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct`. You can change this in `index.html`.
- **Branding:** Update the UI and welcome popup in `index.html` to match your needs.
